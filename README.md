## Overview

I started **Servus.Akka** after I wrote the same quality of life improvements for the third time across different projects. This library contains all those little utilities, extensions, and helpers that make working with Akka.NET more enjoyable and productive.

Instead of copy-pasting utility code between projects or reinventing the wheel, Servus.Akka provides battle-tested solutions for common Akka.NET patterns and pain points.

## Why Servus.Akka?

- **Born from Real Projects**: Every feature comes from actual production use cases
- **Zero Overhead**: Lightweight extensions that don't change Akka.NET's core behavior
- **Developer Friendly**: Intuitive APIs that feel natural in your existing codebase
- **Well Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability
- **Bavarian Quality**: Built with the same attention to detail as a fine German engineering project

## Installation

### Package Manager
```
Install-Package Servus.Akka
```

### .NET CLI
```bash
dotnet add package Servus.Akka
```

### PackageReference
```xml
<PackageReference Include="Servus.Akka" Version="1.0.0" />
```

## Features

### Easy actor registration that supports DependencyInjection

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder();
builder.Services.AddAkka("servus", b =>
{
    b.WithResolvableActors(helper =>
        {
            helper
                .Register<TestActor1>()
                .Register<TestActor2>();
        });
});
```

### Resolvable IActorRef<T> from IServiceProvider
```csharp
var a = Host.Services.GetService<IActorRef<ResolvingTestActor>>();
        a.Tell("hello");
```
